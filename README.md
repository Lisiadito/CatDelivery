**Cat Delivery Telegram Bot**

This little project was my first try to build a Telegram bot and use an API.

This Telegram Bot uses the awesome [Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to deliver you a nice random cat picture into your channel. 
You can specify a **Category** or a **Breed**.

Commands:
- `/help` (show help and get options)
- `/cat` (get a random cat)

The `/help` command will give you options in form of a inline keyboard.

**Future plans**
- subscribe so that you'll get a cat everday automaticly at a specified time
- add a way to get more then one cat at a time
