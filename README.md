**Cat Delivery Telegram Bot**

This little project was my first try to build a Telegram bot and use an API.

This Telegram Bot uses the [Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to deliver you nice random cat picture into your channel. 
You can specify a **Category** or a **Breed**.

I will try to host that bot soon so that everybody can use it.

Commands:
- /help (show help)
- /help/breeds (get a list of available breeds)
- /help/categories (get a list of available categories)
- /cat (get a random cat)
- /breed/<BREEDNAME> (get a random got from specified breed)
- /category/<CATEGORY> (get a random got from the specified category)
